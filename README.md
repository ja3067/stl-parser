# stl-parser
A simple parser for binary .stl geometry files in C++.

## To use

Create a build directory, navigate to it, and then run cmake .. to configure the project. Once CMake has finished, run make to compile the program. This will generate a ./parser executable with syntax ```./parser <stl file path>```. A sample stl file exists in tests/teapot.stl.
